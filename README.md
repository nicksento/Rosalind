# Rosalind

In this notebook i look through several bioinformatics problems from the Rosalind platform, using [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) and [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) packages.

[Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving.  

The problems can be found [here](http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/).
